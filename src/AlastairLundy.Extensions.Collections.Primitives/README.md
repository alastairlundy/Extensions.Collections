# Extensions.Collections.Primitives
A library that adds useful Collection primitives, like HashMaps, to .NET.

Some primitives added include:
* GenericArrayList - An ArrayList style of collection but that natively supports Generics.
* HashMap - A collection type inspired by Java's HashMap but in .NET - It currently uses a Dictionary under the hood, but this may change in the future.
* ReadOnlyHashMap - A ReadOnly version of HashMap that can't be added to.

## How to Use the Project
Get the package from the [Official Nuget Gallery](https://nuget.org/) [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AlastairLundy.Extensions.Collections.Primitives).

If you use Visual Studio, Jetbrains Rider, or an IDE with a Nuget interface built in, you can search for the package through there instead.

## How to build the code

### Part 1
**From the Command Line**: 
1. Open a terminal application
2. In the terminal application, navigate to the directory containing the source code of this project.
3. Enter the command ``dotnet build -c Release`` if you intend to build the project for release, use ``dotnet build -c Debug`` otherwise.

**From an IDE**:
1. Change the Build Configuration in your IDE to ``Release`` if you intend to distribute the built package or ``Debug`` otherwise.
2. Right-click on the project 
3. Select ``Build Selected Projects``, or something similar if it appears differently in your IDE

### Part 2
Regardless of whether you used an IDE or the Terminal to build your package, if it built successfully you'll find the resulting .nupkg and .snupkg files and other dll files in the following locations:
* The ```/bin/Release``` directory inside the source code directory if you built the project using the Release configuration
* or the ``/bin/Debug`` directory inside the source code directory if you built the project using the Debug configuration.

## How to contribute to the project
If you want to add features or make a change to the code:
1. Fork the project if you haven't already done so.
2. Create a new branch in your fork for working on the change.
3. Test the changes to ensure the project still builds.
4. Create a Pull Request (PR) in this project's repo to make the changes, explaining what your changes do and why they should be added in case it's not obvious.
5. A maintainer reviews your PR and checks to see if it can be safely added to the library. If your PR is safe to add the maintainer should accept it and merge it.
6. Hopefully your PR is accepted and merged, if not discuss with the maintainer how you can get your changes approved so that they can be merged.

Thanks in advance for contributing to this project!

## Roadmap
Future versions will aim to add more Collection primitives as well as possibly tweak the behaviour of some primitives in the library.

BigCollections, larger collection primitives that use a 64-Bit Integer for indexes, are planned for a future version.
